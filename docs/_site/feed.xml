&lt;p&gt;This post describes how to use two such batteries with USB adapters and a ‘Y’ USB cable to hot swap the power source for a Raspberry Pi with interrupting the computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many battery powered Pi, Arduino, etc. projects it is not a big deal to shutdown the device, swap in a new battery and power it up again.
But for some remote monitoring projects you would rather not handle that interruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have two identical USB power sources and a ‘Y’ USB cable you can do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cable that I used is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-Cable-External-Drive-Micro/dp/B0047AALS0&quot;&gt;StarTech.com 3 ft USB Y Cable for External Hard Drive USB A to Micro B&lt;/a&gt; - there are a lots of alternatives available. 
These allow you to double up your power source is you need more than a single battery can provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE that they are &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; intended to be plugged into two USB ports that can provide &lt;strong&gt;data&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;power only&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also want to make sure that your two batteries are identical in terms of the voltage they are supplying. 
If they were not then there is the chance that current would flow from the higher voltage to the lower. 
But if you are using identical batteries like I do here this should not be an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach is pretty simple, but here are the specific steps involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setup that I am using includes a Raspberry Pi with the Pi HDMI display, the ‘Y’ USB cable, two Makita batteries and two Makita USB adapters.
The adapters have an On/Off switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20190202_batteries_cable_pi.png&quot; alt=&quot;Makita batteries with Raspberry Pi&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the Pi up and running, powered by battery #1
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20190202_step_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Step 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next Battery #2 is plugged in while &lt;strong&gt;off&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20190202_step_2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Step 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battery #2 is turned &lt;strong&gt;on&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20190202_step_3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Step 3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battery #1 is turned &lt;strong&gt;off&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20190202_step_4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Step 4&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battery #1 is unplugged&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20190202_step_5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Step 5&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pi keeps running with no interruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can keep swapping in fresh batteries for as long as you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Batteries aside, this is a $9 solution to an otherwise tricky problem.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rob Jones</name></author><summary type="html">In a previous post I described how high capacity power tool batteries can be a great way to power microcontroller projects via USB.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Power Tool Batteries as USB Power Sources</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2019/01/24/power-tool-batteries-as-usb-power-source.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Power Tool Batteries as USB Power Sources" /><published>2019-01-24T08:52:37-08:00</published><updated>2019-01-24T08:52:37-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2019/01/24/power-tool-batteries-as-usb-power-source</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2019/01/24/power-tool-batteries-as-usb-power-source.html">&lt;p&gt;This post describes how to use high capacity power batteries from cordless power tools to power microcontroller projects via USB.
This is a great way to power standalone projects for longer periods of time than are possible with typical &lt;strong&gt;Li Poly&lt;/strong&gt; batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have an interest in Do-It-Yourself projects, carpentry, building etc then you probably have a set of
cordless power tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are powered by substantial batteries and with each generation of the technology these have become lighter and more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current set of tools are from &lt;strong&gt;Makita&lt;/strong&gt; and have &lt;strong&gt;18V Lithium Ion&lt;/strong&gt; batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20190124_makita_power_tools.png&quot; alt=&quot;Makita power tools&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These batteries are available with several capacities. I have &lt;strong&gt;2.0 Ah&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;4.0 Ah&lt;/strong&gt; (amp hours).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This capacity comes at a price, however, at &lt;strong&gt;$50&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;$60&lt;/strong&gt; for each battery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20190124_makita_batteries.png&quot; alt=&quot;Makita batteries&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Makita and several of the other manufacturers realized that there was a market for an adapter that would let people charge their
phones or tablets via a USB cable, using their batteries as the power source - ideal for a builder needing to charge a phone on site
without access to regular power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Makita’s version of this is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019WI5XXO&quot;&gt;Makita ADP05 18V LXT Lithium-Ion Cordless Power Source&lt;/a&gt; which 
costs around &lt;strong&gt;$ 20&lt;/strong&gt; from Amazon. This unit slides onto a battery just like a power tool. It has two USB ports covered by dust caps, 
an On/Off slide switch and a belt clip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20190124_makita_battery_w_usb_adapter.png&quot; alt=&quot;Makita battery with USB adapter&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unit can deliver &lt;strong&gt;2.1A&lt;/strong&gt; at 5 V per USB port and you can connect two ports with a suitable cable to deliver &lt;strong&gt;4.2 A&lt;/strong&gt; which is more than 
capable of powering a Raspberry Pi, a display and then some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20190124_makita_battery_w_raspberry_pi.png&quot; alt=&quot;Makita battery with Raspberry Pi&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How long a battery will power your project obviously depends on the load but you run a Raspberry Pi for 24 hours with the 4.0 Ah battery with no problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The output is USB so you can just treat it as a regular power source. In my experiments I measured a voltage of &lt;strong&gt;4.99 V&lt;/strong&gt; which was low enough to 
trigger the low voltage warning on a Raspberry Pi (&lt;em&gt;the yellow lightning bolt in the top right of a console display&lt;/em&gt;) but this did 
not seem to affect the operation of the Pi in the least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The adapter is pretty simple in design with just two prongs that connect to the battery. The battery itself has those as well as a
seven pin connector that only appears to be used by the battery charger - probably to measure charging progress or faults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20190124_makita_battery_next_to_adapter.png&quot; alt=&quot;Makita battery with Raspberry Pi&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice feature of the batteries is a series of red leds that show how much pwer is left when you push the small button below them.
This turns out to be very useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20190124_makita_battery_power_indicator.png&quot; alt=&quot;Makita battery with Raspberry Pi&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because they are designed for use with power tools, these batteries are pretty rugged. There does not appear to be any problem with 
running the battery all the way down and then recharging it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need more than &lt;strong&gt;2.1 A&lt;/strong&gt; then you can connect the two USB ports using a special USB ‘Y’ cable to get &lt;strong&gt;4.2 A&lt;/strong&gt; - for example 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-Cable-External-Drive-Micro/dp/B0047AALS0&quot;&gt;StarTech.com 3 ft USB Y Cable for External Hard Drive USB A to Micro B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20190124_makita_battery_w_double_usb_cable.png&quot; alt=&quot;Makita battery with Raspberry Pi&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These batteries would be an expensive solution to powering your projects if you don’t already have a set of power tools. 
But if you already made that investment then an additional $20 gives you a very useful capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a bonus you have a nice way to charge your phone or tablet next time you lose power !&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My gear is all Makita but &lt;strong&gt;Dewalt&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Milwaukee&lt;/strong&gt; power tools have effectively the same thing and there are multiple third party 
copycat devices available on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rob Jones</name></author><summary type="html">This post describes how to use high capacity power batteries from cordless power tools to power microcontroller projects via USB.

hooked up with loose wires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time you have to move them you risk pulling out a wire and having to figure out where it was supposed to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adafruit and others sell some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adafruit.com/product/942&quot;&gt;acrylic project boards&lt;/a&gt; but these can be a bit cramped for some of my designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My solution is to mount my projects on small Artist Boards - small wooden frames that support a 
smooth wood panel that are used for small oil paintings, and other art projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20190122_project_board_w_pi_breadboard.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ampersand board with Pi and Breadboard&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They look good, all the components and wires stay in place and your projects are easy to store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;strong&gt;Ampersand Museum Series Panels&lt;/strong&gt; - specifically their &lt;strong&gt;hardbord&lt;/strong&gt; (sic) panels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20190122_project_board_in_wrapper.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ampersand board in wrapper&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are not generally available on &lt;strong&gt;Amazon&lt;/strong&gt; but you can find them on the website for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dickblick.com/products/ampersand-hardbord/&quot;&gt;Blick art supplies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get the &lt;strong&gt;3/4 inch cradled Hardbord&lt;/strong&gt; type which have a smooth brown face and a 3/4 inch supporting frame. 
The finish is great and they look really professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are available in sizes from 6” x 6” up to 24” x 36”. I typically get the &lt;strong&gt;6” x 8”&lt;/strong&gt; panels which cost around &lt;strong&gt;$10&lt;/strong&gt; each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-mount-circuit-boards-to-the-project-board&quot;&gt;How to mount circuit boards to the project board&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mounting holes in Arduino, Raspberry Pi and other circuit boards tend to be 2.5 mm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nylon standoffs and screws in this size are a good way to mount boards securely on a panel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are available as sets from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adafruit.com&quot;&gt;Adafruit&lt;/a&gt; for around &lt;strong&gt;$15&lt;/strong&gt; each, as well as from various sellers on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adafruit.com/product/3658&quot;&gt;White Nylon Screw and Stand-off Set – M2.5 Thread&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adafruit.com/product/3299&quot;&gt;Black Nylon Screw and Stand-off Set – M2.5 Thread&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the US nobody has metric drill bits … &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; … however, you can use a &lt;strong&gt;3/32 in&lt;/strong&gt; drill bit which is &lt;strong&gt;2.4 mm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Place the circuit board on the panel in the desired location and mark the mounting holes on the panel, keeping away from the supporting frame.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Drill the holes in the panel.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gently screw a 2.5 mm standoff with a ‘male’ extension into each hole - they should fit tightly when you screw them in hand tight - no need for a nut on the other side of the panel.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20190122_project_board_w_standoffs.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ampersand board with standoffs&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Place the board over the ‘female’ end of the standoff and screw in a 2.5mm bolt through the board into the standoff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20190122_project_board_w_fpga.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ampersand board with fpga&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to add a breadboard on the panel, these often come with double sided tape on their base, so just stick this in place next to your board.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rob Jones</name></author><summary type="html">Building Raspberry Pi and Arduino projects can get messy if you have the microcontroller, a breadboard and other devices all hooked up with loose wires.</summary></entry></feed>
